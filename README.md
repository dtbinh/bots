# Bots

A simple library for controlling robots using Ruby.

## What is this?

Bots is a simple library for controlling robots. You can use the library to create controller scripts that manipulate robots. The current version only controls [legged robots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legged_robot). The example `hex.rb` controller script allow you to control a [hexapod robot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexapod_(robotics)).

Bots has a built-in [simulator](https://github.com/billhsu/hexapod-sim) created using the [Bullet Physics Library](http://bulletphysics.org). You can use the simulator to test run your controller scripts. You can either run it real-time or dump the output of your controller script to a sequence file to be loaded on the simulator.

This library uses the [hexapod simulator](https://github.com/billhsu/hexapod-sim) by [Bill Hsu](https://github.com/billhsu).

Here's a hexapod controlled using Bots in action.

## How to use

To run this in simulator mode:

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `bundle install` to install the files
3. Create a robot controller file by requiring `bots.rb`
4. Run the robot controller file in REPL using pry `pry -r ./hex.rb` (assuming your controller file is named `hex.rb`)
5. To exit the REPL enter `!!!` and press enter

To run this in the sequence dump mode:

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `bundle install` to install the files
3. Create a robot controller file by requiring `bots.rb`
4. Run the robot controller file in REPL using pry `pry -r ./hex.rb`
5. When have finished your activities the REPL would have dumped your activities into a `.seq` file
6. Exit the REPL
7. Run `./load.rb xxx.seq` where `xxx.seq` is your sequence file


## How to create a robot controller 

Creating a robot controller is straightforward.

### Subclass `Bots::Controller` 

```ruby
class Hexapod < Bots::Controller 
  ...
end
```

### Create a constructor for your controller

You should call the constructor of your superclass with the type of engine, create legs and do whatever else you want to initialize the robot. In the example below I am creating legs for a hexapod i.e. robot with 6 legs. 

```ruby
def initialize(type=:sim)
  super(type)
  @legs = {}
  @legs[:front_left]   = Leg3DOF.new(:left, 1, 2, 3)
  @legs[:middle_left]  = Leg3DOF.new(:left, 4, 5, 6)
  @legs[:back_left]    = Leg3DOF.new(:left, 7, 8, 9)
    
  @legs[:front_right]  = Leg3DOF.new(:right, 32, 31, 30)
  @legs[:middle_right] = Leg3DOF.new(:right, 29, 28, 27)
  @legs[:back_right]   = Leg3DOF.new(:right, 26, 25, 24)
              
  @left_legs = [:front_left, :middle_right, :back_left]
  @right_legs = [:front_right, :middle_left, :back_right]      
end
```

### Do stuff with the robot!

In the example below we're creating a method to simplify moving the bot.

```ruby
def move(leg, c, f, t)
  execute @legs[leg].actuate(c, f, t)
end
```

the `Leg3DOF` has a method `actuate` that moves the 3 servos controlling the leg (coxa, femur and tibia) at the same time. In the `move` method we call actuate on the chosen leg, then execute the action. the `execute` method executes the leg actuation and creates the command that is then sent to the controller's engine.
